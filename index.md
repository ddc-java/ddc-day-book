## Overview

DDC Day Book is a GitHub Pages theme by [Nick Bennett](mailto:nick@nickbenn.com), customized extensively from [Leap Day](https://pages-themes.github.io/leap-day/) by [Matt Graham](https://twitter.com/mattgraham), and incorporating ideas from [Jason Grimes'](https://grimesit.com) [Jekyll Chapterbook](https://github.com/jasongrimes/jekyll-chapterbook). It is intended for use in the [Deep Dive Coding](https://deepdivecoding.com) Java + Android Bootcamp, in the publication and distribution of tutorials, lecture notes, homework assignments, practical exam problems, etc. It may also be used for student project documentation sites. 

Markdown content is supported by the [kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/parser/kramdown.html) parser. Code highlighting is done by the [Rouge](http://rouge.jneen.net/) code highlighter; the current list of language identifiers recognized on fenced code blocks can be found [here](https://github.com/rouge-ruby/rouge/wiki/List-of-supported-languages-and-lexers). Rendering of mathematical expressions written in $\rm\LaTeX$ is supported by the [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) library.

The content of this site is intended not only to introduce the DDC Day Book theme, but also to present a basic set of guidelines for writing curriculum and documentation content that will be published in GitHub Pages using this theme. In other words, these pages present a curriculum & documentation style guide, supported by the DDC Day theme, for the DDC Java Enterprise & Mobile bootcamp. Please note, however, that this site is _not_ intended for use as a coding style guide; that is the role of the [DDC Java+Android Style Guide](/style-guide/).
