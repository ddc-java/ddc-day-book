This section is intended as a style guide---for creating curriculum for the Deep Dive Java training programs in general, and for creating curriculum presented with the DDC Day Book theme in particular. Some of the guidelines are focused on high-level curriculum organization---namely, the pages and sections into which content is organized---while others address the formatting and typography of that content.
